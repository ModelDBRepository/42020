paper:

Brunel N (2000) Dynamics of sparsely connected networks of excitatory
and inhibitory spiking neurons. J Comput Neurosci 8:183-208

The brunel.sli file was supplied by Marc-Oliver Gewaltig and runs
under NEST.  Please contact Marc-Oliver Gewaltig

20120105 IMPORTANT NOTE:
*** the brunel.sli file included here is incompatible with the most
recent version of NEST.  Please use the version in

examples/nest/brunel-2000.sli

in your local NEST installation. It is also suggested (and supported
by "Tom Tetzlaff" [t.tetzlaff at fz-juelich.de]) to control NEST from
python using PyNEST: see

http://nest-initiative.org/index.php/PyNEST

In

pynest/examples/brunel-delta-nest.py

you'll find a python script for the Brunel network example.
